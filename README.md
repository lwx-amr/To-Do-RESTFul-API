# Welcome to To-Do RESTFUl API

### Welcome to To-Do RESTFUl API! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with it.

## Description

To-Do RESTFUl API is an API for managing the server-side work of your To-Do applications. If you have some UI for a To-Do application you can easily use my API for making your application alive and allowing your users to control their notes. It's open-source so if you want to add some feature, edit an existing one, or even fix a bug you found go ahead and make a PR or reach me and I will update it as soon as possible.

## Used Tools

* #### Node.js: The whole server is developed using Node.js as a runtime environment.
* #### Express.js: Express is the most common framemork for Node.js.
* #### MongoDB: Mongo is the database used for this project and I used MongoDB Atlas as a Cloud-hosted MongoDB service.
* #### Mongoose: A great ORM for MongoDB as it provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.
* #### JWT: I used JSONWebToken to control the authentication process of the API requests.
* #### Babel: Babel helps to compile ES6 code to a compatible JavaScript code.
* #### Mocha: JavaScript test framework running on Node.js.
* #### ESLint: A tool for patterns reporting in ECMAScript/JavaScript code and making code more consistent.
* #### Heroku: Platform as a service (PaaS) and there is a live instance of my API master branch deployed and running on it.
