# Welcome to To-Do RESTFUl API

##### Welcome to To-Do RESTFUl API! Here you'll find all the documentation you need to get up and running with it.



### Description

ToDo RESTFUl API is an API for managing server side work of your To-Do app. If you have an UI for a To-Do application you can easily user my API for making your application alive and allowing your users to control their notes. It's an open source so if you want to add some feature, editing an existing one or even fixing a bug you found go ahead and make a PR or reach me and I will update it as soon as possible.
